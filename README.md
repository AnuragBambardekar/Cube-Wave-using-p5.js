Cube Wave by Bees and Bombs <br>

The artist BeesandBombs makes amazing algorithmic looping GIFs! Here's my attempt to recreate one of my favorite GIFs in JavaScript with p5.js and the WEBGL renderer. <br>
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! <br>
WebGL (Short for Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. <br>

**Learning Outcomes:** Orthographic Projection, WebGL, p5.js
